  abstract     = {Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) is an approach taken from
                  process optimization and it exists a variety of algorithms
                  to help organizing the matrix in a form that reflects the
                  architecture and highlights patterns and problematic
                  dependencies. However, the existing DSM implementations have
                  a lack of information in their visualization. That is why, we
                  enhanced DSM by adding written and colored information in the
                  visualization to improve the architecture understanding of a
                  software system and the support of its remodularization. This
                  visualization has been implemented on top of Moose which is a
                  collaborative research platform for Software Analysis and
                  Information Visualization. This report presents my
                  internship done at the research centre INRIA Lille - Nord
                  Europe with the RMoD Team led by S. Ducasse.},
