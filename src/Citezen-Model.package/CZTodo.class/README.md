* on CZentry we could say that all the keyx not in the extended set should be removed. This would simplify the logic.

* we should propose a clean option to clean seriously the AndreasSystemProfiler 

* sorting entries should be independent of it. 

* apparently editor field does not contain people.


notExpanded either returns a string or integer

* how can we filter a list of entries out that fullfils a criteria

* gatherer from a doc to a bibset should add tests
* bibraw printer -> test
* add test for CZSet , 

* generatingCollection -> generatedCollection?
* requestBib???
* CZOutputer should be subclass of CZDocumentVisitor ?

* should check that   - BibTeX -> '@comment{Here is my comment}' is a valid entry.  probably it is.

* introduce setter for used fields (replace field at: #author but field author: 

* introduce key: as instance creation for entry
	instead of (CZentry type: #article) key:
			or (CZentry type: CZEntry article) key:
	-> CZEntry typeArticle key: 
	
* stef footer/header
* script to split author and nonauthors
* rmod report
* do not use copyTwoLevel 
* there is a redundancy between 
	CZEntry initialize and CZChecker>>initializeTypeFieldsMatching
