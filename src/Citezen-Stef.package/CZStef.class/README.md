CZStef new latex generate 

The previous expressions generate well the bib with the PDF.
But the html header is too generic so we should copy and paste the body and this is not really good.

In adding the ref to pdf in html do not look good.



In general there is a problem because I do not pass the correct header and footers to the exporters.
See users of CZXHTMLDocBuilder except for the Rescued class I do not see how this is made correctly 
May be this is done in Kozen.
