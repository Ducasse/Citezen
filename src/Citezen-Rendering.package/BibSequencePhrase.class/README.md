A BibSequencePhrase presents its sub-phrases in a sequence, with configurable decorations between the elements or around the whole sequence.

This is useful for e.g. enumerating authors. i.e. in "W, X, Y, and Z." there is no initiator, comma-space as a separator, ', and ' as a lastSeparator, and period as a terminator.
